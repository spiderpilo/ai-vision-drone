# AI Vision Follow Drone

An autonomous drone system that uses computer vision to detect and follow a target while maintaining a safe, configurable distance.  
This project focuses on real-time perception, control feedback, and hardware–software integration for autonomous flight.

## 🚁 Project Overview

The goal of **AI Vision Follow Drone** is to design and build an autonomous drone capable of:

- Detecting a human target using computer vision
- Tracking the target in real time
- Maintaining a consistent following distance
- Adapting movement based on the target’s position and motion
- Operating safely with hardware constraints and fail-safes

This project is built as a **full-stack robotics system**, combining AI perception, control logic, embedded hardware, and mechanical design.
