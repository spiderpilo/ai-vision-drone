# Vendor / Community CAD Models

This folder contains CAD files that were **not created by me**.

These models are provided by manufacturers or the open-source community and are used
for reference and fitment during mechanical design and system integration.

They allow me to:
- Verify mounting hole patterns
- Check component clearances
- Design custom mounts and brackets
- Assemble an accurate system-level CAD model
